# RE-M1STY

C rewrite of repo: M1STY.

This program can do:

+ set window opacity
+ set window size
+ toggle always-on-top
+ toggle mouse click-through
+ hide window

Sounds useful, actually...

How to use:

1. Build with gcc
2. Launch the program
3. Set the target window as foreground window (just click it)
4. Press certain set of keys
   > For example:\
   > Hold `Alt` + `N` + `-`, then the opacity of that window is decreased
5. (optional) Click the console, then press `Alt` + `N` + `\` to permanently hide the console
   > This operation can also used on other windows\
   > You can only kill the hidden program by `taskkill` or something alike
6. Press `Alt` + `N` + `Backspace` to exit the program
